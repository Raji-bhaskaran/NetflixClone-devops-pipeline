**Netflix Clone DevOps Pipeline**

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Netflix clone application using modern DevOps practices and industry-standard tools. The implementation showcases automated build, test, security scanning, and deployment processes across a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.

Architecture
The project implements a comprehensive DevOps workflow that includes:

Frontend: React.js Netflix Clone Application
Containerization: Docker for application packaging
CI/CD: Jenkins Pipeline for automation
Code Quality: SonarQube for static code analysis
Security: Trivy for vulnerability scanning
Orchestration: Kubernetes cluster (1 Master + 2 Worker nodes)
Registry: Docker Hub for image storage
API Integration: TMDB (The Movie Database) for movie content

Implementation Features
Automated CI/CD Pipeline

Source code integration with version control
Automated build and testing processes
Code quality gates and compliance checks
Security vulnerability assessments
Automated deployment to production environment

Container Orchestration

Multi-replica deployment for high availability
Auto-scaling capabilities based on demand
Self-healing infrastructure with automatic recovery
Rolling updates with zero downtime
Load balancing across worker nodes

Security Integration

Static code analysis during build process
Container image vulnerability scanning
Quality gate enforcement before deployment
Secure credential management
Network security policies

Pipeline Workflow
The automated deployment process follows these stages:

Source Code Management: Code changes trigger pipeline execution
Build Environment Setup: Initialize build tools and dependencies
Code Quality Analysis: SonarQube performs static code analysis
Quality Gate Validation: Enforce code quality standards
Dependency Installation: Install application dependencies
Security Scanning: Trivy scans for vulnerabilities
Container Build: Create Docker image with application
Registry Push: Upload image to Docker Hub
Deployment: Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
Verification: Validate successful deployment

Getting Started
Prerequisites

4 Ubuntu Virtual Machines (1 for Docker, 3 for Kubernetes)
Cloud platform account (AWS/Azure)
Docker Hub account for image registry
TMDB API key for movie data integration

Installation Steps

Set up virtual machine infrastructure
Install and configure Docker environment
